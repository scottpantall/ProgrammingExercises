C# exercises with unit tests

This is a list of coding exercises sent by a friend with unit tests for each exercise. Here's how i got started...
	* Downloaded file from email into my working directory.
	* Opened Visual Studio. Realized I had not opened it in a while so I let it update. Waited 2 hours....
	* Opened the solution file for the project. Realized it used unit tests. Watched videos on unit tests in C# on a PluralSight course I have already taken.
	* Run tests. All the tests fail. Woot! I know how to run tests again!
	* Set up git repository
  * Got started on the first exercise and it all rolled from there...
